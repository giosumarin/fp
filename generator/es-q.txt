%%% Exercise on generators


1. 
Sets can be seen as lists without repetitions. Validate the set
version of the ordered/insert property, namely

"if ss is an ordered set then inserting x in ss is still ordered"

You need to define a generator such that it only emits ordered lists
w/o repetitions. Then quantify over such list.

Hint: use mapFilter with the remove function as seen before

(Again: use lists, not Sets)

Finally, redefine you generator so that lists are not only ordered and
w/o repetitions, but  also have length between n and m with m > n.
   

2. The functions 

 List.zip : ('a list -> 'b list -> ('a * 'b) list)

and

List.unzip : (('a * 'b) list -> 'a list * 'b list)

are inverse of each other, under the condition that they operate on lists
of the same length

2.1 Formulate an Arbitrary for pair of lists of ints of the same length
2.2 State and validate that sip and unzip are inverse using the above Arbitary
