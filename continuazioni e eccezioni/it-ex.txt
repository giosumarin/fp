1. Give an iterative defintion of List.length
	- via an accumulator
	- via fold
        - via continuations

	Quickcheck their equivalence


2. Give an iterative defintion of List.Map
	- via an accumulator
        - via continuations

	Quickcheck their equivalence and informally evaluate their performances
	in terms of time and space


3. Give definitions  with accumulators and continuations of the pre/in/post-order tree traversal
functions.

	Quickcheck their equivalence.


4. Declare a standard recursive and an accumulator-based function 

sum: int*int -> int, where for m ≥ 0 and n ≥ 0.

sum(m, n) = m + (m + 1) + (m + 2) + · · · + (m + (n − 1)) + (m + n)

    Quickcheck their equivalence


5. Declare an iterative version of Fibonacci.

Hint: if F_n is the n-th Fibonacci number, the equation you're
looking for is

	ifib n F_k F_(k + 1) = F_(k + n)

 Quickcheck the equivalence with the standard one "fib"
 on small ints, using this code


let prop_fib n =
  let smallGen n =
    Arb.filter (fun x -> x < n) Arb.from<int>
  Prop.forAll (smallGen  n )
       (fun m ->  m > 0 ==> lazy (fib m = itfib m))

example: prop_fib 10
